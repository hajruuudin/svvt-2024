### Overview
The test covers the F1 homepage along with its sister sites, like the F1 store, Tickets,
hospitality and so on... The testing suite consists of 15 test scenarios, 10 of which
are considered CRITICAL (cover key functions on the webpages) and 5 are EXTRA (they are 
not as important but still serve a key function)
****
**Please note:** The tests ultimately depend on the current look of the Webpages, and have
been created for the webpage at 12.01.2025. Accessing the test suite at any future point in 
time might result in test failure due to website updates, structure changes or domain
changes. As of its last release, **12/15** test scenarios run without errors while **3/15**
scenarios cannot be completed due to bot protection.
